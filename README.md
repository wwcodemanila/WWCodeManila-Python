# Welcome to the world of Python!

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/WWCodeManila/Python)

For beginners, we will learn the basic concepts of
programming using Python. This can be your jump off towards web development,
scripting, data processing and more!

For immediate/advanced Pythonistas, let's spread our knowledge of Python and learn more!

If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate on our [Gitter group](https://gitter.im/WWCodeManila/Python).
