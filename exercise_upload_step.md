### How to share your work

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) if none yet, or sign in. 
2. Create `wwcode-python` repository if none yet. You will upload your works there.
  *  If you are a GIT user and cloned your `wwcode-repository`, you may skip below and just push your work.
  *  In the toolbar(upper right of your screen), select `create new` (plus sign) -> `New Repository`
