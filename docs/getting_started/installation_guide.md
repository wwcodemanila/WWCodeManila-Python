## Check existing installation

We need Python first! 

!> For our study group, we will be using `Python 3`, preferably >= `Python 3.6` :)

To check if Python is already installed, open your terminal or command prompt.
- For Windows users, search for `cmd`
- For Linux and Mac users, search for `terminal`

After opening the terminal/command prompt(cmd), type the following command.
```shell
python --version
```

or

```shell
python3 --version
```

This will tell you what version of python is currently installed in your computer.

```shell
Python 3.6.0

```
> If python 3 is already installed, skip the next part.
